## Learning Outcomes

This project, while simple, compiled a lot of very useful topics for Javascript development.

Primarily I got more comfortable with Javascript, diving into its OOP capabilities by experimenting with how classes are implemented. I also familiarized myself with some more complex DOM manipulation to get the behavior I wanted, as well as learned how to store data in `window.localStorage`.

I used `bootstrap-datepicker` for the date selection feature, using CDN's to install the required add-ins.

I learned a lot about configuring webpack with the `webpack.config.js` file to get the Javascript, CSS, and image files to all compile. I am not sure you actually should use webpack for asset files, but it was interesting to see how it worked anyway.
